# Data Engineering with Microsoft Azure 

Welcome to the repository for projects completed as part of the Data Engineering with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree program. This collection of projects showcases the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, emphasizing the design of data models, construction of data warehouses, creation of data pipelines, and manipulation of large datasets on the Azure platform.

## Project List

### 1. Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
This project centers around the creation of a non-relational database using Apache Cassandra. It involves modeling event data for a music streaming app and constructing an ETL pipeline to seamlessly load the data into the Cassandra database.

### 2. Building an Azure Data Warehouse for Bike Share Data Analytics
In this project, we delve into the realm of Azure Synapse Analytics to develop a robust data warehouse solution. The objective is to analyze bike share data and extract meaningful insights from the vast dataset.

### 3. Building an Azure Data Lake for Bike Share Data Analytics
This project explores the implementation of the Lakehouse architecture on the Azure Databricks platform. The goal is to analyze bike share data stored in a data lake, harnessing the power of Spark for efficient data processing.

### 4. Data Integration Pipelines for NYC Payroll Data Analytics
Focused on NYC payroll data analytics, this project is dedicated to the development of data integration pipelines. These pipelines extract data from diverse sources, undergo essential transformations, and load it into a data warehouse for in-depth analysis.

Feel free to explore each project directory for detailed documentation, code, and insights gained from the hands-on experience in these data engineering endeavors. These projects reflect a journey through the intricacies of data engineering with Microsoft Azure.
